Hi, I'm Gianfranco, I'm a Full Stack developer graduated from several courses and in continuous self-taught learning.
I have 500 hours of learning in real environment simulation with agile methodologies.

I develop myself working both in a team and individually thanks to the tools acquired through
my training in the technology environment but also for my growth both personally and professionally.

I consider myself a versatile, charismatic person who wants to learn and grow in the IT world. I am looking for
of a team to which I can contribute and expand my knowledge in this area which I am passionate about. I remain at your disposal
Thank you.
